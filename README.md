# Kib Symbol Builder

This is a symbol builder for KiCad, meant to speed up the process of creating high-quality and/or very large symbols.

By manually inputting pin names and positions or importing a CSV file you can quickly separate pins in different units
and different named "blocks" in the same unit. This can be done manually and with regular expressions.
